Dear Sir\Ma'am,

I'm Harsh Dubey, a Software Engineer with expertise building high-performance, scalable systems using JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Python, SQL, AWS, Docker, and Git.

At Continental India, I developed and maintained 12+ Dockerized, AWS-powered backend services (Node.js, Express, Swagger, AWS Lambda), reducing QA efforts by 35% and cutting provisioning time by 45%. Additionally, I optimized PLC logic and OPC-UA integrations, resulting in an 18% throughput increase and 22% improved defect detection accuracy.

I also gained international exposure during workshops in Germany, China, and Thailand—delivering SCADA dashboard integrations that reduced information lag by ~40%. Those experiences strengthened my ability to work effectively across teams and locations.


Notable projects include:

- Bidly: Real-Time Two-Sided Bidding Platform: Built on Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB Atlas (TTL), Mongoose, Socket.IO, Clerk Auth, JWT, Node.js, and deployed on Vercel, achieving <200 ms API latency, <1 second live updates, and efficient data cleanup using MongoDB’s TTL.

- ⁠IoT-Enabled Elevator Scheduler: Leveraged Embedded C/C++, ESP8266, HC-05 Bluetooth, Node.js, and Firebase to develop REST APIs syncing 20+ concurrent sessions, boosting elevator dispatch efficiency by 35%.

I’m enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring this experience to a relevant role. I would welcome a conversation to discuss how my background aligns with your team's objectives.

Best regards,
