Dear HR / Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to apply for Software Development Engineer roles at your organization. With over two years of hands‑on experience at Continental India, I’ve architected and delivered scalable, real‑time data systems that production teams rely on daily. My focus is always on writing clear, maintainable code and automating workflows to eliminate manual effort and streamline operations.

In my current role as Senior Engineer – Data Generation & Data Quality, I:

* Built & maintained 12+ microservices** for real‑time data ingestion and transformation across three production sites, cutting QA effort by 35%.
* Designed an Edge Device Manager** to orchestrate containerized apps on 60+ devices via AWS and GitHub, reducing provisioning time by 45%.
* Integrated Swagger‑based APIs** for remote configuration, authentication, and monitoring—standardizing deployments and eliminating manual errors.
* Optimized PLC logic & OPC‑UA pipelines**, boosting system throughput by 18% and increasing defect detection accuracy by 22%.
* Delivered 60+ Agile sprint deliverables** in Jira‑driven workflows, collaborating with global cross‑functional teams.

Key projects that demonstrate my full‑stack and real‑time expertise:

* IoT‑Enabled Elevator Scheduler: Led a 3‑member team to prototype an ESP8266‑based booking system, syncing 20+ concurrent users via RESTful APIs and Firebase, improving dispatch efficiency by 35%.
* Bidly (Real‑Time Two‑Sided Bidding Platform): Architected a Next.js/Node.js application with Socket.IO for live updates (<1 s latency), Clerk/OAuth for secure auth, and MongoDB TTL indexing to auto‑expire stale data—achieving <200 ms API response times.
* Parkinson’s Detection Research**: Co‑authored a paper (ICCCNet 2025) achieving 97.4% accuracy using Python, Gradient Boosting, and advanced signal‑processing features.

What I bring:

* Strong proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Python, SQL, and frameworks like Next.js, React, Node.js.
* Expertise in Docker, AWS, OPC‑UA, CI/CD pipelines, and RESTful API design.
* A track record of delivering deployment‑ready solutions in Agile environments, backed by international workshops in Germany, China, and Thailand.

I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how my practical, automation‑driven approach can help your team deliver reliable, high‑impact software. Thank you for your time and consideration—I’ve attached my resume for your review.

Best regards,
Harsh Dubey
