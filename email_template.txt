Dear Hiring Team,

I am a passionate Software Development Engineer with 2+ years of proven success designing and delivering high‑performance, scalable systems using JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Python, SQL, AWS, Docker, and Git. At Continental India, I architected and maintained 12+ Dockerized, AWS‑powered microservices (Node.js, Express, Swagger, Lambda), which reduced QA cycles by 35% and cut provisioning time by 45%. My work optimizing PLC logic and integrating OPC‑UA interfaces drove an 18% increase in throughput and 22% improvement in defect detection accuracy.

In addition to my core engineering experience, I have collaborated across global teams—leading SCADA dashboard integrations in Germany, China, and Thailand that reduced data‑lag by ~40%. I thrive in Agile environments, contribute clean, well‑tested code (95%+ coverage with Jest/Mocha), and enjoy mentoring peers to elevate overall team productivity.

Key Highlights:

Bidly (Real‑Time Bidding Platform): Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB Atlas (TTL), Socket.IO, Auth (Clerk/JWT) — achieved <200 ms API latency and <1 s live updates.

IoT‑Enabled Elevator Scheduler: Embedded C/C++, ESP8266, Bluetooth, Node.js, Firebase — orchestrated 20+ concurrent sessions, boosting dispatch efficiency by 35%.

Best Practices: RESTful API design (50K+ daily requests), microservices architecture, container orchestration (Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), TDD and System Design.

I am excited to contribute this blend of hands‑on development, architectural vision, and cross‑functional collaboration to your team. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and drive for technical excellence can help achieve your organization’s goals.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Harsh Dubey
