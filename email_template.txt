Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m writing to express my interest in Software Development Engineer roles. Over the past year, I’ve worked as a practical and reliable developer in industrial environments, building production-ready systems that teams depend on daily. My focus has always been on writing clear, maintainable code that supports essential operations without unnecessary complexity.

In my recent role at Continental, I designed and maintained backend services powering six production lines, using Python and C++. These systems improved real-time data accuracy by approximately 50%, helping reduce downtime and improve consistency. I also engineered ICONICS and DOPAC dashboards that nearly halved manual QA efforts, enabling teams to monitor and address issues live, rather than waiting for periodic checks.

I also gained international exposure during workshops in Germany, China, and Thailand—delivering SCADA dashboard integrations that reduced information lag by ~40%. Those experiences strengthened my ability to work effectively across teams and locations.

Key Highlights:

-Reliable data systems: Built Python and C++ backend services for six production lines, boosting real-time data accuracy by ~50%.

-QA automation: Created ICONICS/DOPAC dashboards that cut manual QA time by ~45% through live analytics.

-Edge and control integration: Implemented the COUGAR® system at three facilities to improve data capture by ~50%, and developed an edge-pipeline to monitor tire weight, raising accuracy by ~30%.

-Performance optimization: Upgraded control logic (IPC → PLC) to increase throughput by 15% and reduce latency by 20%.

-End-to-end delivery: Followed full SDLC cycles, managed Agile sprints in Jira, and earned recognition among Continental’s Top 12 Strategic Projects.

What I bring:

-Proficient in Python, C++, OPC-UA, dashboard tools, PLC/IPC logic, and edge-device pipelines.

-A structured, Agile-friendly approach with a focus on deployment-ready solutions.

-A mindset geared toward building dependable, maintainable software—not just flashy features.


I’d appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my practical skills can support your engineering goals. Thanks for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
